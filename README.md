# Dr. Shadowman and the Multiverse of Multi-cluster Madness

**Doing a Docker?**  *That's cool*

**Kicking off some Kubernetes?**  *Yeah, cool too*

**Operating an OpenShift?** *Now we're cooking with grease*

**Messing with multiple clusters?** *This is where the madness begins*

## What is this?

This repository is a collection of GitOps-centric resources to manage Kubernetes/OpenShift - and even more so, multiple clusters in a hub-of-hubs architecture, without descending into psychosis.  This isn't an end-all-be-all or gospel for how to do everything, but rather a collection of blueprints and patterns that can be used to build out a GitOps-centric multi-cluster management strategy of your own.

## What's the workflow?

### Hub of Hubs Bootstrapping

Most mutli-cluster architectures operate in a "Hub and Spoke" model, and can be extended even further by operating a "Hub of Hubs" pattern.  In an OpenShift context, there are many ways to bootstrap a Hub or Hub of Hub cluster, and arguably the method with the lowest level of effort and maintenance would be to use the OpenShift GitOps Operator (ArgoCD) to bootstrap things.  So then all you have to do is:

1. Start with a fresh OpenShift cluster
2. `oc apply -f hub-of-hubs/bootstrap/`
3. *Do some Secrets seeding stuff...*
4. `oc apply -f hub-of-hubs/gitops-config/`
5. ??????
6. PROFIT!!!!!1

From there, ArgoCD will sync things to that repo in order to install Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management and a Basic MultiClusterHub.  You could add additional things to the `hub-of-hubs/bootstrap/` directory to install other things, however from here forward this repository will leverage RHACM to manage the clusters via Policies.

### Secret Seeding

The tragic truth is that there is likely never going to be a true one-command line standing up of a full stand multi-cluster environment, probably even single clusters really when you think about it - all because of Secrets Management.

At many points you'll need to use some secrets for things such as authenticating to a Git repo or connecting to infrastructure providers.  Some common secrets you may need to seed are:

- Git repo credentials
- Infrastructure credentials (AWS, Azure, GCP, vSphere, IPAM, etc)
- Container Pull Secrets
- SSH Keys
- Vault Token for External Secrets Operator to authenticate to Hashicorp Vault

You can read more about a quick start in how to seed these secrets in the [Secret Seeding](examples/cheat-sheets/secret-seeding.md) cheat sheet.
